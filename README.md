# com.elisseck.discountreport

This is a demo! It's very alpha and has not been tested outside of d7 development environment. Hoping to see what's possible by collboration to build better reporting for Organizations tha use Events and Discount Codes extensively.

Adds a report akin to "Events> Income (detail)" but with civiDiscount functionality.
